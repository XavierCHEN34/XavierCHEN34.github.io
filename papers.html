                                                This work presents AnyDoor, a diffusion-based image generator with the power to teleport target objects to new scenes at user-specified locations in a harmonious way. 
                                                Instead of tuning parameters for each object, our model is trained only once and effortlessly generalizes to diverse object-scene combinations at the inference stage. 
                                                Such a challenging zero-shot setting requires an adequate characterization of a certain object. To this end, we complement the commonly used identity feature with detail features, 
                                                which are carefully designed to maintain texture details yet allow versatile local variations (e.g., lighting, orientation, posture, etc.), supporting the object in 
                                                favorably blending with different surroundings. We further propose to borrow knowledge from video datasets, where we can observe various forms (i.e., along the time axis) of a single object, 
                                                leading to stronger model generalizability and robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach 
                                                over existing alternatives as well as its great potential in real-world applications, such as virtual try-on and object moving.

                                                Open-vocabulary image segmentation is attracting increasing
                                                attention due to its critical applications in the real
                                                world. Traditional closed-vocabulary segmentation methods
                                                are not able to characterize novel objects, whereas several
                                                recent open-vocabulary attempts obtain unsatisfactory
                                                results, i.e., notable performance reduction on the closedvocabulary
                                                and massive demand for extra data. To this
                                                end, we propose OPSNet, an omnipotent and data-efficient
                                                framework for Open-vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation.
                                                Specifically, the exquisitely designed Embedding Modulation
                                                module, together with several meticulous components,
                                                enables adequate embedding enhancement and information
                                                exchange between the segmentation model and the
                                                visual-linguistic well-aligned CLIP encoder, resulting in
                                                superior segmentation performance under both open- and
                                                closed-vocabulary settings with much fewer need of additional
                                                data. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted
                                                across multiple datasets (e.g., COCO, ADE20K,
                                                Cityscapes, and PascalContext) under various circumstances,
                                                where the proposed OPSNet achieves state-of-theart
                                                results, which demonstrates the effectiveness and generality
                                                of the proposed approach. The code and trained models
                                                will be made publicly available.

                                                In this paper, we formally address universal object detection, which aims to detect every scene and predict every category. The dependence on human annotations, the
                                                limited visual information, and the novel categories in the
                                                open world severely restrict the universality of traditional
                                                detectors. We propose UniDetector, a universal object detector that has the ability to recognize enormous categories
                                                in the open world. The critical points for the universality of UniDetector are: 1) it leverages images of multiple sources and heterogeneous label spaces for training
                                                through the alignment of image and text spaces, which guarantees sufficient information for universal representations.
                                                2) it generalizes to the open world easily while keeping the
                                                balance between seen and unseen classes, thanks to abundant information from both vision and language modalities. 3) it further promotes the generalization ability to
                                                novel categories through our proposed decoupling training manner and probability calibration. These contributions allow UniDetector to detect over 7k categories, the
                                                largest measurable category size so far, with only about
                                                500 classes participating in training. Our UniDetector behaves the strong zero-shot generalization ability on largevocabulary datasets like LVIS, ImageNetBoxes, and VisualGenome - it surpasses the traditional supervised baselines by more than 4% on average without seeing any corresponding images. On 13 public detection datasets with
                                                various scenes, UniDetector also achieves state-of-the-art
                                                performance with only a 3% amount of training data.

                                                Interactive segmentation enables users to extract masks
                                                by providing simple annotations to indicate the target, such
                                                as boxes, clicks, or scribbles. Among these interaction formats,
                                                scribbles are the most flexible as they can be of arbitrary
                                                shapes and sizes. This enables scribbles to provide
                                                more indications of the target object. However, previous
                                                works mainly focus on click-based configuration, and the
                                                scribble-based setting is rarely explored. In this work, we
                                                attempt to formulate a standard protocol for scribble-based
                                                interactive segmentation. Basically, we design diversified
                                                strategies to simulate scribbles for training, propose a deterministic
                                                scribble generator for evaluation, and construct
                                                a challenging benchmark. Besides, we build a strong framework

                                                (PAM) and a Corrective Refine Module (CRM), for the
                                                task. Extensive experiments show that ScribbleSeg performs
                                                notably better than previous click-based methods. We hope
                                                this could serve as a more powerful and general solution for
                                                interactive segmentation. Our code will be made available.

                                                Interactive segmentation allows users to extract target
                                                masks by making positive/negative clicks. Although explored
                                                by many previous works, there is still a gap between
                                                academic approaches and industrial needs: first, existing
                                                models are not efficient enough to work on low-power devices;
                                                second, they perform poorly when used to refine preexisting
                                                masks as they could not avoid destroying the correct
                                                part. FocalClick solves both issues at once by predicting
                                                and updating the mask in localized areas. For higher
                                                efficiency, we decompose the slow prediction on the entire
                                                image into two fast inferences on small crops: a coarse
                                                segmentation on the Target Crop, and a local refinement
                                                on the Focus Crop. To make the model work with preexisting
                                                masks, we formulate a sub-task termed Interactive
                                                Mask Correction, and propose Progressive Merge as the solution.
                                                Progressive Merge exploits morphological information
                                                to decide where to preserve and where to update, enabling
                                                users to refine any preexisting mask effectively. FocalClick
                                                achieves competitive results against SOTA methods
                                                with significantly smaller FLOPs. It also shows significant
                                                superiority when making corrections on preexisting masks.

                                                The attention mechanism of computer vision represented by a non-local network 
                                                improves the performance of numerous vision tasks while bringing computational 
                                                burden for deployment Wang et al. (2018). In this work, we explore to release the
                                                inference computation for non-local network by decoupling the training/inference 
                                                procedure. Specifically, we propose the implicit non-local network (iNL). During 
                                                training, iNL models the dependency between features across long-range affinities 
                                                like original non-local blocks; during inference, iNL could be reformulated as only 
                                                two convolution layers but can rival non-local network. In this way, the computation 
                                                complexity and the memory costs are reduced. In addition, we take a further step and 
                                                extend our iNL into a more generalized form, which covers the attentions of different 
                                                orders in computer vision tasks. iNL brings steady improvements on multiple benchmarks
                                                 of different vision tasks including classification, detection, and instance 
                                                 segmentation. In the meantime, it provides a brand–new perspective to understand the
                                                  attention mechanism in deep neural networks.

                                                In click-based interactive segmentation, the mask extraction
                                                process is dictated by positive/negative user clicks;
                                                however, most existing methods do not fully exploit the
                                                user cues, requiring excessive numbers of clicks for satisfactory
                                                results. We propose Conditional Diffusion Network
                                                (CDNet), which propagates labeled representations
                                                from clicks to conditioned destinations with two levels of
                                                affinities: Feature Diffusion Module (FDM) spreads features
                                                from clicks to potential target regions with global similarity;
                                                Pixel Diffusion Module (PDM) diffuses the predicted
                                                logits of clicks within locally connected regions. Thus, the
                                                information inferred by user clicks could be generalized to
                                                proper destinations. In addition, we put forward Diversified
                                                Training (DT), which reduces the optimization ambiguity
                                                caused by click simulation. With FDM,PDM and DT, CDNet
                                                could better understand user's intentions and make better
                                                predictions with limited interactions. CDNet achieves
                                                state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.

                                                deals with each target object as a tracklet. For more sta-
                                                ble and robust performance over video sequences, SAT gets
                                                awareness for each state and makes self-adaptation via two
                                                feedback loops. One loop assists SAT in generating more
                                                stable tracklets. The other loop helps to construct a more
                                                robust and holistic target representation. SAT achieves a
                                                promising result of 72.3% J&F mean with 39 FPS on
                                                DAVIS2017-Val dataset, which shows a decent trade-off be-

                                                Considering the diversified requirements in intelligent video surveillance for 
                                                transformer substation, a unified algorithm for object tracking and segmentation
                                                 was proposed which is able to track and segment humans, vehicles, and many other
                                                  foreign objects with real-time speed. Based on SiamRPN, an efficient segmentation
                                                   branch was designed to get high quality mask for target object. In addition, in 
                                                   order to enhance tracking accuracy with the result of segmentation, a mask quality 
                                                   scoring method was proposed. Besides, the proposed method adopts templet updating
                                                    strategy, which makes the method more robust for long sequences. This algorithm not 
                                                    only reaches high accuracy and robustness in the practical task of video surveillance 
                                                    for transformer substation, but also gets high performance on VOT2018 benchmark.

                                                In this paper, an algorithm for real-time human segmentation is proposed. 
                                                This algorithm uses connection relations of human joints provided by pose 
                                                estimation as prior knowledge which brings striking enhancement for the 
                                                accuracy of human segmentation. High-quality segmentation results can be 
                                                produced with real-time speed dealing with large range of human pose under 
                                                complicated scenes.

                                                Compared with other semantic segmentation tasks, portrait segmentation requires both higher precision and faster 
                                                inference speed. However, this problem has not been well studied in previous works. In this paper, 
                                                we propose a lightweight network architecture, called Boundary-Aware Network (BANet) which selectively
                                                extracts detail information in boundary area to make high-quality segmentation output with real-time( >25FPS) 
                                                speed. In addition, we design a new loss function called refine loss which supervises the network with image 
                                                level gradient information. Our model is able to produce finer segmentation results which has richer details 
                                                than annotations.
